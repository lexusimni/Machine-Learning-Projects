### üß† [Customer Churn Prediction with Explainable AI ‚ûú](https://github.com/lexusimni/Churn-Prediction-Explainable-AI)

Predict customer churn using XGBoost and explain model decisions using SHAP. This project emphasizes **interpretability**, showing which features influence the model most and why, making it ideal for business applications and stakeholder transparency.

### üß™ [Sparse Feature Selection for High-Dimensional Data ‚ûú](https://github.com/lexusimni/human-activity-feature-selection)

Apply L1 regularization, mutual information, and Boruta to reduce noise and improve model performance on high-dimensional activity recognition data. Focus is placed on **feature reduction** techniques critical for real-world sensor data applications.

### ‚öñÔ∏è [Fairness and Bias Detection in ML Models ‚ûú](https://github.com/lexusimni/Fairness-Bias-Audit)

Audit machine learning models for **demographic bias** using tools like AIF360 and Fairlearn. This project includes fairness metrics, disparity visualizations, and mitigation strategies to ensure ethical and responsible AI modeling.

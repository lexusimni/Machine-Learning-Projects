# ✅ Machine Learning Projects

Not just models.. these are **explainable**, **fair**, and **built to perform**. From predicting who’s about to dip (👋 churn), to fighting algorithmic bias, to cutting through noisy data like a pro, this is ML that actually *does something*.

### 📉 [Customer Churn Prediction with Explainable AI ➜](https://github.com/lexusimni/Churn-Prediction-Explainable-AI)

Built an XGBoost model that predicts if customers are gonna ghost, and then breaks down *why*. Powered by **SHAP** for crystal clear explainability, so stakeholders stop guessing and start understanding.

### ✂️ [Sparse Feature Selection for High-Dimensional Data ➜](https://github.com/lexusimni/human-activity-feature-selection)

High dimensional data? Not a problem. This one slices through the noise using **L1 regularization, Boruta, and mutual info**, keeping only the features that actually matter. No fluff, just signal.

### ⚖️ [Fairness and Bias Detection in ML Models ➜](https://github.com/lexusimni/Fairness-Bias-Audit)

Tired of biased models? Same. This project uses **AIF360 and Fairlearn** to sniff out unfairness in your predictions, then hits it with strategies to fix it. Responsible AI, because ethics > accuracy.
